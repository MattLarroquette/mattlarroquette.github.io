          <h2>Title: Real-time Earthquakes 4.5M+, 1 week</h2>
          <p>This is a map created by using ArcGIS that takes a look at earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher that occured all across
            the globe within the last week. The neat thing about this map is that it updates un real time. The map refreshes every minute meaning that if the USGS records an
            earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater, then this map will reflect that earthquake. If you click on a target a pop up will appear with the USGS logo on it. If you click that
            you will be brought to that earthquake's specific event page.</p>

          <h2>Title: Report A Suspect Sighting across LSU's Campus</h2>
          <p>This map uses ArcGIS' feature layer to allow people to fill out a form online with information about a "suspect". This information, along with they place the spotted
          the "suspect", appears on a public map everyone can see. It is essentially using something like crowdsourcing to let others know that they saw a "suspect" around this location.
          This kind of map has many uses from locating suspects to letting your community know about things like potholes or downed power lines. The button will take you to the form citizens
          fill out for it to appear on the map.</p>
