          <h2>Title: Real-time Earthquakes 4.5M+, 1 week</h2>
          <p>This is a map created by using ArcGIS that takes a look at earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher that occured all across
            the globe within the last week. The neat thing about this map is that it updates un real time. The map refreshes every minute meaning that if the USGS records an
            earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater, then this map will reflect that earthquake. If you click on a target a pop up will appear with the USGS logo on it. If you click that
            you will be brought to that earthquake's specific event page.</p>
