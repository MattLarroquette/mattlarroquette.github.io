          It starts you out at in the quad and ends at the newly renovated student urec center. On the way you will visit the world famous "Death Valley"
          and also have a one of a kind experience when you visit LSU's live, on campus mascot, Mike the Tiger. <a href="http://arcg.is/2FbqHdV"> Click Here for the tour!</a><p>

        <p class="caption"><br>This is a map created by using ArcGIS that takes a look at earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher that occured all across
          the globe within the last week. The neat thing about this map is that it updates un real time. The map refreshes every minute meaning that if the USGS records an
          earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater, then this map will reflect that earthquake. If you click on a target a pop up will appear with the USGS logo on it. If you click that
          you will be brought to that earthquake's specific event page. <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=627c388e7fb34674827740af699d9684"> Click Here to view the map!</a><p>
